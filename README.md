# Habitica Automation Scripts

This is a hobby project I created to make it easier for me to manage and automate various tasks in Habitica. Manually switching equipment sets was tedious, so I built these scripts to automate the process and make my Habitica experience smoother.

## What's Inside

This repository contains various Google Apps Scripts that automate different aspects of Habitica. Each script has its own purpose and setup instructions.

## Available Scripts

- **[Equipment Switcher](docs/equipment_switcher.md)** - Automatically switches between different equipment sets when you buy specific rewards

## How to Use

Each script has its own detailed README with setup and usage instructions. Click on the links above to view the documentation for each script.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repo and adapt these scripts for your own use! These are personal hobby scripts, so they're provided as-is.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are for personal use and are not officially affiliated with Habitica. Use at your own risk and always keep backups of your important data.
